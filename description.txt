Adds the Starfallen Race, a race based off of the Astral Infection from the Calamity Mod. The race is made for rogue players in Calamity, but since it gives throwing damage it will also work for other throwing damage weapons in other mods or in the base game.

There may be some bugs or balance issues due to this being my first attempt at a custom race mod, if you care enough you can dm me on discord at Autumn#2053 and I'll try to fix whatever is wrong with it.
